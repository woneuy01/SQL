2.5 - Unions
To simply append two queries (with identical fields) together, put a UNION ALL between them.

SELECT
'FEB' AS MONTH,
PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID,
PRODUCT_NAME,
SUM(PRICE * QUANTITY) AS REV
FROM PRODUCT LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID

WHERE ORDER_DATE BETWEEN '2017-02-01' AND '2017-02-28'
GROUP BY 1,2,3

UNION ALL

SELECT
'MAR' AS MONTH,
PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID,
PRODUCT_NAME,
SUM(PRICE * QUANTITY) AS REV
FROM PRODUCT LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID

WHERE ORDER_DATE BETWEEN '2017-03-01' AND '2017-03-31'
GROUP BY 1,2,3

---Using UNION instead of UNION ALL will remove duplicates, which should not be necessary in this case.

You should strive not to use unions as they often encourage bad, inefficient SQL. 
Strive to use CASE statements or other tools instead. In this example, it would have been better to do this:

2.6 - GROUP CONCAT

A neat little trick you can do on some database platforms (like SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL) is the group_concat() 
aggregate function. This will concatenate all values in a column as an aggregation, and can be used in conjunction with a GROUP BY like MIN, MAX, AVG, etc.

This shows a concatenated list of values of PRODUCT_ID's ordered for each ORDER_DATE.


SELECT ORDER_DATE,
group_concat(PRODUCT_ID) as product_ids_ordered

FROM CUSTOMER_ORDER
WHERE ORDER_DATE BETWEEN '2017-02-01' AND '2017-02-28'
GROUP BY ORDER_DATE

--Putting the DISTINCT keyword inside of it will only concatenate the DISTINCT product ID's.

SELECT ORDER_DATE,
group_concat(DISTINCT PRODUCT_ID) as product_ids_ordered

FROM CUSTOMER_ORDER
WHERE ORDER_DATE BETWEEN '2017-02-01' AND '2017-02-28'
GROUP BY ORDER_DATE

---GROUP_CONCAT is a helpful function to compress the results into a single record,
in a single cell, often in a reporting context.
--Note that GROUP_CONCAT is used in MySQL and SQLite, but is often called STRING_AGG on other platforms such as Oracle,
PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.

Exercise 1
Bring in all records for CUSTOMER_ORDER, but also bring in the total quantities ever ordered each given PRODUCT_ID and CUSTOMER_ID.
**
SELECT CUSTOMER_ORDER_ID,
CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID,
ORDER_DATE,
CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID,
QUANTITY,
sum_qty

FROM CUSTOMER_ORDER
INNER JOIN
(
    SELECT CUSTOMER_ID,
    PRODUCT_ID,
    SUM(QUANTITY) AS sum_qty
    FROM CUSTOMER_ORDER
    GROUP BY 1, 2
) total_ordered

ON CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID = total_ordered.CUSTOMER_ID
AND CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID = total_ordered.PRODUCT_ID

--Or if you choose to use a common table expression...

**WITH total_ordered AS (
    SELECT CUSTOMER_ID,
    PRODUCT_ID,
    SUM(QUANTITY) AS sum_qty
    FROM CUSTOMER_ORDER
    GROUP BY 1, 2
) 

SELECT CUSTOMER_ORDER_ID,
CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID,
ORDER_DATE,
CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID,
QUANTITY,
sum_qty

FROM CUSTOMER_ORDER INNER JOIN total_ordered

ON CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID = total_ordered.CUSTOMER_ID
AND CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID = total_ordered.PRODUCT_ID



4.5A Self Joins

--We can join a table to itself by invoking it twice with two aliases.
--This can be useful, for example, to look up the previous day's order quantity (if any) for a given CUSTOMER_ID and PRODUCT_ID:
--전날 주문 물량
SELECT o1.CUSTOMER_ORDER_ID,
o1.CUSTOMER_ID,
o1.PRODUCT_ID,
o1.ORDER_DATE,
o1.QUANTITY,
o2.QUANTITY AS PREV_DAY_QUANTITY

FROM CUSTOMER_ORDER o1
LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER o2

ON o1.CUSTOMER_ID = o2.CUSTOMER_ID
AND o1.PRODUCT_ID = o2.PRODUCT_ID
AND o2.ORDER_DATE = date(o1.ORDER_DATE, '-1 day')

WHERE o1.ORDER_DATE BETWEEN '2017-03-05' AND '2017-03-11'

-- 전날이 아니라 직전 주문한 날 인경우 sub query 를 쓴다.

SELECT ORDER_DATE,
PRODUCT_ID,
CUSTOMER_ID,
QUANTITY,
(
    SELECT QUANTITY
    FROM CUSTOMER_ORDER c2
    WHERE c1.ORDER_DATE > c2.ORDER_DATE
    AND c1.PRODUCT_ID = c2.PRODUCT_ID
    AND c1.CUSTOMER_ID = c2.CUSTOMER_ID
    ORDER BY ORDER_DATE DESC  -- 역순으로 가장 최근일자 선택 모든 항목마다 각각 query가 계산됨
    LIMIT 1
) as PREV_QTY
FROM CUSTOMER_ORDER c1
